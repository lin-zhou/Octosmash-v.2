# TO DO
Some ideas for features to implement after I finish redoing the base game.

## High Priority
Here are some things I should definitely do:
* Make knockback smoother
* Improve shielding system

## Optional, but nice to have
These are a couple of nifty things that I might reasonably get to:
* Support more than two players
* Allow players to map their own controls
* Be able to replay the game without choosing characters again (and without that pesky lag from Octosmash 110)
* Healing items/items in general
* Sound/music
* Multiple lives + respawning (and being able to choose number of stocks to play)

## Aesthetic Cleaning
Just because I want the game to look nice:
* Render characters based on degree of forwardness so it looks perspectively accurate
* Nicer title screen
* Nicer fonts
* Different colored magic blasts

## Cool, but probably won't get to
Either I don't have an idea of how to implement it, or I don't really have the resources to do it (ex. art):
* Melee attacks (would require some animations, probably)
