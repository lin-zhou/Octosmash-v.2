# TO DO
Some ideas for features to implement after I finish redoing the base game.

## High Priority
Here are some things I should definitely do:
* ~~Be able to replay the game without choosing characters again (and without that pesky lag from Octosmash 110)~~
* ~~Support more than two players~~
* Create a menu screen so that players can navigate the game dynamically
* Make knockback smoother
* Improve shielding system

## Optional, likely to implement
* Multiple lives + respawning (and being able to choose number of stocks to play)
* Sound/music
* Healing items

 ## Optional, somewhat likely to implement
* Different movement speeds and damage amount for different characters
* Allow players to map their own controls
* Different backgrounds for main game
* Other items (projectiles)

## Aesthetic Cleaning
Just because I want the game to look nice:
* Nicer number of players selection screen
* Render characters based on degree of forwardness so it looks perspectively accurate
* Nicer title screen
* Nicer fonts
* Different colored magic blasts

## Cool, but probably won't get to
Either I don't have an idea of how to implement it, or I don't really have the resources to do it (ex. art):
* Melee attacks (would require some animations, probably)
* Ability to play against CPU opponents
